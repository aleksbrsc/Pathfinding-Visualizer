# Pathfinding-Visualizer
A tool for visualizing procedural generation and pathfinding algorithms.
Users can customize mazes, select solving algorithms, and visualize the process.

### Features
Mazes: 
- Choose from various maze presets
- Generate a maze with algorithms like Depth-First Search, Prim's Algorithm, and more
- Paint your own mazes with left-click to create walls and right-click to delete walls 

Algorithms:
- Explore pathfinding algorithms including Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search, Bidirectional Search, and Greedy Best-First

Extras:
- Customize the visualization with features like animated path drawing, borders, speed control, theme selection, and more

Clear and Visualize:
- Clear the current visualization or initiate the visualization of the selected algorithm
- Once visualization is complete, the solution can simply be reset without the entire maze being lost

### How to Use:
1. Select a maze preset, generate a custom maze, or paint one yourself
2. Choose a pathfinding algorithm
3. Customize the visualization using the extra features if desired
4. Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action
5. Click "Reset" when maze is visualized to reset the visualization.
6. Click "Clear" to clear the entire maze
